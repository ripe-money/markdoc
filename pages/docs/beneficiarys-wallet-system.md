title: Beneficiary's Wallet System

# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

Ripe generates a dedicated wallet account for every unique beneficiary when they receive their first payment through our system. This wallet separation strategy provides several benefits:

1. **Clear Payment Tracking**: We can easily identify which wallet receives a valid payment through Ripe.
2. **Accurate Disbursement**: By cross-referencing with our internal database, we can trigger the release of fiat funds to the correct beneficiary.
3. **Future Network Effects**: As cryptocurrency adoption grows, beneficiaries will discover they already have a crypto wallet with transaction history, customer analytics. Thus, unlocks potential for future merchant onboarding.
