Ripe strictly adheres to the Travel Rule by collecting both originator and beneficiary names and limiting transaction amounts to comply with regional thresholds.

Being one of the design partners of Circle's _Compliance Engine_ (a compliance-as-a-service product), we work closely with Circle to monitor wallets used for Ripe transfers. The _Compliance Engine's_ _"Transaction Screening"_ feature is particularly well-suited to our business needs.

Before allowing a payment transaction, we check the sender's wallet address against allowlists and blocklists to ensure the originator is not involved in high-risk activities or money laundering.
